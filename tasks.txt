high priority:
- camera limits - lock camera within map
- add turret to shoot players as a test of ray performance
- player's showing weapons / muzzle flashes on weapons etc
- run down players
- frustruum culling
- sound effects
- lighting
- server chat (use html overlaying game)
- score system
- website:
   - scoreboard
   - optional registration
   - player customisation -> upload custom image for player

bugs:
- fix "kv of entities" syntax in project-sandbox; doesn't work with IE11
- remove old js
- #wrekt in big, wben player dies

future ideas / consider:
- change clientside logic from 60ms to 100ms to reduce computation
- moving tile types into json, which client can cache for a long time?
