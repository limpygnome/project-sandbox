high priority:
- allow ents to spawn with pre-defined spawn point for map objects, rather than faction spawn -> and only use that spawn
= allow ents to have a property where they cannot be moved -> physics properties . static
- add turret to shoot players as a test of ray performance
- player's showing weapons / muzzle flashes on weapons etc
- run down players
- limited spawn protection e.g. cant die for 10s
- network interpolation
- sound effects
- lighting
- server chat (use html overlaying game)
- score system
- website:
   - scoreboard
   - optional registration
   - player customisation -> upload custom image for player
- deployment scripts / ansible

bugs:
- fix "kv of entities" syntax in project-sandbox; doesn't work with IE11 or minify
- remove old js
- #wrekt in big, wben player dies

future ideas / consider:
- change clientside logic from 60ms to 100ms to reduce computation
- moving tile types into json, which client can cache for a long time?
- update exact tiles/segments of map
- chunk map and cache, rather than send entire map
