- remove playerid from commands, server should know - reduces commonly wasted bytes

- bring back activity above chat
-- make scores/activity/chat modules, which can be turned off; have activity turned off by default
--- weapons could have modules in the future, or something like that...
-- make UI modules moveable
- add ability so that camera bounds triggered better; if zoom, triggers limits. doesnt on initial map load / ent set etc...
-- define as global hook?
- add trigger for when player id received, so that UI can set current player on scoreboard
- improve text of selected inventory slot item
- move scoreboard to a partially/transparent top-right box
- move chat to top-left partially/transparent box
-- perhaps combine with activity? we do need ways to state areas captured
- consider bottom-right for mini-map
- change background of canvas to generic stars / space
- change server to allow non-auth users to observe game
- fix inventory slot depleted not being set, since styling
- add inventory blocking style, so item changes colour during recharge -> perhaps like old game with vertical progress colour transition
- change maps to allow for tile and non-tile maps
- add map property for gravity / physics settings
-- physics engines for diff maps? diff props for diff maps?
