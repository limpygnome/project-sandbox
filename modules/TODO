- remove playerid from commands, server should know - reduces commonly wasted bytes

- make scores/activity/chat modules, which can be turned off; have activity turned off by default
--- weapons could have modules in the future, or something like that...
-- make UI modules moveable
-- define as global hook?
- add trigger for when player id received, so that UI can set current player on scoreboard
- improve text of selected inventory slot item
- consider bottom-right for mini-map
- change background of canvas to generic stars / space
-- or have it as option for maps (preferred)
- change server to allow non-auth users to observe game
- fix inventory slot depleted not being set, since styling
- add inventory blocking style, so item changes colour during recharge -> perhaps like old game with vertical progress colour transition
- change maps to allow for tile and non-tile maps
- add map property for gravity / physics settings
-- physics engines for diff maps? diff props for diff maps?

bugs/security:
- limit chat message size; both clientside and server -> server shud disconnect if violated and log error

nice features:
- add page on controls / how to play -> make it overlay available all over site?
