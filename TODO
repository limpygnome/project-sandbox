critical goals
================
- none

long-term goals
================
- allow maps to control default ents of player / perhaps use service to spawn player based on session data
--- default ent + loadout *or* use serialized stuff from session
--- already partially implemented


- introduce ships
- introduce new weapons/abilities
-- flares -> shoots out random entities, used for rockets to hit them, rather than ship -> shoots out and explodes, only minimal damage, make rocket health low
-- shields
--- basic bullets/small energy shot weapon
--- warp drive
--- heavy missile battery
--- basic turrets -> consider making rotation clientside / send locked-on ent id instead?
- introduce shipyard
--- player has collection of inventory items, can pick which ones are in a slot -> drag+drop?
--- order determines how ship is rendered
--- allow player to buy new ship for cash $$$
- render inventory items on ships i.e. turrets/radars/warp drives etc
- introduce asteroids / blackholes
- introduce warning UI
- introduce capturing areas for more money
- introduce killing a player drops 10% of their funds (for collection) + reset player
- introduce teams
- introduce ship weights for players to kamikazi -> new player ships are nothing, to avoid spam damage


short-term goals/issues
============================
- may need to use treeset and allow components to specify order for executing component operations

- backgrounds need ratio
- make backgrounds generic for all maps

- remove playerid from commands, server should know - reduces commonly wasted bytes

- change design pattern so that classes are organised into modules, rather than by type
-- allows individual units to be turned on/off
- make scores/activity/chat modules, which can be turned off; have activity turned off by default
--- weapons could have modules in the future, or something like that...
-- make UI modules moveable
-- define as global hook?
- add trigger for when player id received, so that UI can set current player on scoreboard
- improve text of selected inventory slot item
- consider bottom-right for mini-map
- change background of canvas to generic stars / space
-- or have it as option for maps (preferred)
- change server to allow non-auth users to observe game
- fix inventory slot depleted not being set, since styling
- add inventory blocking style, so item changes colour during recharge -> perhaps like old game with vertical progress colour transition
- change maps to allow for tile and non-tile maps
- add map property for gravity / physics settings
-- physics engines for diff maps? diff props for diff maps?

bugs/security:
- cull number of chat / activity messages, could be spammed and crash client browsers
= limit speed of chat messages
- limit chat message size; both clientside and server -> server shud disconnect if violated and log error
- limit content of chat messages

nice features:
- add page on controls / how to play -> make it overlay available all over site?
